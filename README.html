<blockquote>
<p>These items are primarily to enable and encourage you to work directly with representations of regular languages in preparation for future work and upcoming exams. Use of JFLAP allows you to check the correctness of your work, enables exploration of operational behaviors of the formalism, and provides a consistent means for sharing and assessment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The intended and recommended approach is as follows:
Attempt each of the primary activities without reference to others' solutions or use of an automated computational tool (such as JFLAP).
Develop a solution and a set of data that helps validate the solution.
After you have deemed a solution satisfactory, implement that solution in JFLAP and use JFLAP's features to analyze and test your work.
Clean up or annotate your solution as necessary for submission.
This approach best prepares you for success on exams and putting this knowledge into practice.</p>

<p>The assignment started off pretty smoothly then in talking with classmates there was a lot of disagreement and misunderstanding about whether we needed to take the complement of the strings not contained. It didn't really make sense to me that we could recognize it by negation unless it was by rejecting that and accepting everything else possible but with the confusion I wanted to check. Process wise I used this markdown format to keep notes and drew on a paper pad at first to brainstorm and then implemented within jflap to check on it. They're cool to work with, after you start doing it for a while you start to think totally differently.</p>

<p>I am still working on getting the handle of using the tables and  transitions functions methodology for solving them. I understand what needs to happen and how to do so but not some of the methods for doing so seem more confusing that just doing it. I used tables just to kind of organize my thoughts but it seemed more complex to perform delta transition functions across the board d when it was relatively clear from looking at it how to do it. Something I need more practice with.</p>

<p>We've been doing some of this in Principles of Programming languages which I am taking concurrently so I have relatively more experience here. I had no idea though how fast and powerful of method jflap was for creating/learning/experimenting with grammars. Well really across the board. I got it set up during the summer and messed with it a little bit but had no idea how helpful it and powerful for helping to develop an intuition of being able to think more in the way of a FA.</p>
